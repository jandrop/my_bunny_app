# Signs of Anger or Aggression

Knowing these signs will help you avoid bites and respect your rabbit's boundaries.

---

## Growling
- Guttural warning sound.
- Means: "back off" or "I don't like this."
- If you ignore the growl, they may bite.

---

## Boxing Posture
- Stands up on back legs.
- Front paws raised.
- Ready to strike or scratch.

---

## Lunging
- Runs toward you or another rabbit.
- Head down and ears back.
- Can end in a bite.

---

## Biting
- A gentle nip can be to get your attention.
- A hard bite is **real aggression**.
- Causes: territoriality, pain, fear.

---

## Raised Tail
- Tail erect and tense.
- Combined with other signs = imminent aggression.

---

## How to Respond

- **Respect the warning** → back away.
- Don't punish or yell (increases fear).
- Identify the cause (territory? pain? hormonal?).
- Spaying/neutering greatly reduces hormonal aggression.
- Consult the vet if behavior is new.

# Guide to Choosing Good Pellets for Your Rabbit

Pellets should be a supplement, not the base of the diet.
They represent approximately **5%** of daily food intake. Their function is to provide minerals and vitamins that complement hay.

## What Should Good Pellets Have?

Good pellets should be:
- **In pellet format** (not colorful mixes).
- **High in fiber** → minimum 20%.
- **Moderate protein** → 12–14%.
- **Low in calcium**.
- **No grains**, no honey, no seeds, no dried fruits.
- **No added sugars**.

---

## Absolutely Avoid...

- "Muesli" type mixes → cause selectivity and dental problems.
- Pellets with artificial colors.
- Pellets with cookies, seeds, or fruits.

## Pellets by Age

### **Baby Rabbits (< 6 months)**
- Can have more nutrient-rich pellets.
- Can also have **alfalfa**, but should be removed as they grow.

### **Adult Rabbits**
- High-fiber, low-calcium pellets.
- No more than 1–2 tablespoons per day (depending on rabbit size).

---

## Recommended Amount

- Standard adult rabbit: **1 tablespoon per kilogram of body weight.**
- Never leave unlimited pellets.
- Hay always comes first.

## How to Change Pellets

Always do it **gradually**:

| Days | Recommended Mix |
|------|-----------------|
| 1–3  | 75% old pellets + 25% new |
| 4–6  | 50% + 50% |
| 7–9  | 25% + 75% |
| 10   | 100% new |

This prevents diarrhea or soft droppings.

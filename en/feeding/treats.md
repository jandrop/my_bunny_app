# Fruits and Treats Guide for Your Rabbit

Fruits are **treats**, not basic food. Due to their high sugar content, they should be given in moderation as a special reward.

## How Much Fruit Can They Eat?

- **Maximum:** 1-2 tablespoons per 2 kg (4.5 lbs) of body weight.
- **Frequency:** 1-2 times per week maximum.
- **Proportion:** Less than **5%** of their total diet.

> Remember: Carrots are technically a "treat" due to their high sugar content, not a daily vegetable.

# Bonding Process

Bonding is the process of introducing two rabbits to become companions. It requires patience and supervision.

## Step by Step

### Phase 1: Preparation (1–2 weeks)

1. **Separate housing** but close together.
2. They can see and smell each other, but **not touch**.
3. Place enclosures next to each other.

### Phase 2: Scent Exchange (1 week)

- Exchange items between enclosures:
  - Blankets
  - Toys
  - Litter boxes (uncleaned)
- This gets them used to each other's scent.

### Phase 3: Meetings in Neutral Territory

**Very Important:** Neutral territory is KEY.

- Use a space where **neither has been**:
  - Bathroom
  - Kitchen (if they don't know it)
  - A friend's house
  - Empty bathtub
  - Car (parked)

- **Short sessions**: 10–20 minutes at first.
- **Increase gradually** if it goes well.
- **ALWAYS supervise**.

### Phase 4: Supervised Cohabitation

- Once they don't fight in neutral territory, try at home.
- Start with short sessions.
- Separate them when you're not there.

### Phase 5: Permanent Cohabitation

- When they spend several hours together without problems.
- When they groom each other.
- When they sleep together.

## The Importance of Companionship

- In the wild, they live in **colonies** of up to 20 individuals.
- Prolonged loneliness causes **stress and depression**.
- A human **cannot replace** another rabbit.
- They are crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk), when you sleep, they're awake.

### Benefits of Having Two Rabbits

- They play and exercise together.
- They provide warmth and security.
- They live happier and healthier.

## Prerequisite: Spaying/Neutering

**Before putting two rabbits together, BOTH must be spayed/neutered.**

### Why?
- Prevents unwanted litters.
- Reduces hormonal aggression.
- Makes bonding much easier.
- Prevents uterine cancer in females (very common).

### Waiting Time
- Wait **2–4 weeks** after surgery.
- Males can remain fertile for up to **6 weeks** after.

## Best Combinations

| Combination | Difficulty | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Male + Female | Easy | Most natural and successful |
| Female + Female | Medium | Works well if both spayed |
| Male + Male | Difficult | Possible but requires more patience |

### Factors That DON'T Matter
- Size (a dwarf can live with a giant).
- Breed.
- Age (though adult + adult is easier).

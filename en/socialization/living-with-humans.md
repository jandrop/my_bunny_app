# Living with Humans

Besides the company of another rabbit, your relationship with them is also very important.

---

## How to Earn Their Trust

- **Sit on the floor** → rabbits fear predators from above.
- **Let them approach** → don't chase or grab them.
- **Offer treats** → vegetables from your hand.
- **Speak softly** → loud noises scare them.
- **Respect their space** → don't pull them from their hiding spot.

## Time to Trust

Every rabbit is different:
- Some trust in **days**.
- Others take **months**.
- Rescued rabbits or those with trauma may need more time.

## Signs They Trust You

- Approaches to greet you when you arrive.
- Lies down relaxed near you.
- Accepts pets without running.
- Licks you (they're grooming you!).
- Does binkies (joy jumps) when they see you.

## Common Mistakes

- Picking them up when they're not ready.
- Chasing them to pet them.
- Making sudden movements.
- Yelling or making loud noises.
- Forcing them to interact when they don't want to.

## Tips

- **Patience is key** → don't force the relationship.
- **Routine** → rabbits feel safe with predictable schedules.
- **Reward approach** → positively reinforce when they come to you.
- **Respect their personality** → some rabbits are more independent.

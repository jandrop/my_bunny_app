## Warning Signs

| Behavior | What to Do |
|----------|------------|
| Intense chasing | Separate and try again another day |
| Biting with fur pulled | Separate immediately |
| Fighting with growling | Separate carefully |
| One always runs away | Shorter sessions |
| Excessive mounting | Normal, but watch the reaction |

## What to Do If They Fight

1. **Wear thick gloves** → bites hurt.
2. **Don't put hands in** directly.
3. Use a towel or cardboard to separate them.
4. A water spray can interrupt (before it escalates).
5. **Let them rest** before trying again.

## Common Mistakes

- Putting unneutered rabbits together.
- Introducing them in one's territory.

## Loss of a Companion

When a rabbit dies, the survivor may experience real grief.

### Signs of Grief
- Stops eating or eats less.
- Becomes lethargic or sad.
- Searches for their companion around the house.
- Greater need for human attention.

### What to Do
- **Let them see the body** → helps them understand they're gone.
- Give them more attention and company.
- Keep their routine as normal as possible.
- Offer their favorite vegetables to stimulate appetite.

### When to Worry
- If they don't eat anything for more than **12 hours** → urgent vet visit.
- If lethargy lasts more than a week without improvement.

### New Companion
- Don't force them to bond immediately.
- Wait until they've recovered emotionally.
- When ready, consider adopting another rabbit.
- Grief can last **weeks or months**.

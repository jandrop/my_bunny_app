# The Rabbit's Digestive System

A rabbit's digestive system is **very delicate** and different from other animals. Understanding it is key to preventing serious problems.

## How Digestion Works

Rabbits are **hindgut fermenters**. This means:
- Fermentation occurs in the **cecum**, a large chamber in the intestine.
- They need specific bacteria to digest fiber.
- They produce **two types of droppings**: regular and cecotropes.

### The Digestive Process
1. Food passes through the stomach and small intestine.
2. Indigestible fiber is expelled as **hard feces** (normal pellets).
3. Digestible fiber goes to the **cecum** for fermentation.
4. The cecum produces **cecotropes** rich in nutrients.

## Types of Droppings

### Normal Feces (Fecal Pellets)
- Round, dry, and hard pellets.
- Dark brown color.
- Left in the litter box.
- Should be **abundant** (50–300 per day).

### Cecotropes
- Clusters of soft, shiny pellets.
- Covered in mucus.
- Strong, characteristic smell.
- **The rabbit eats them directly from their bottom** (cecotrophy).

### Important
Seeing cecotropes on the floor occasionally is normal.
Seeing them **always** can indicate:
- Inadequate diet (little hay, too much pellets).
- Obesity (can't reach to eat them).
- Dental problems.

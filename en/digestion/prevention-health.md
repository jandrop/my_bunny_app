# Prevention and Digestive Health

Maintaining healthy digestion is fundamental for your rabbit's overall health.

## Prevention

### Correct Diet
- **80% hay** → indigestible fiber that stimulates intestinal movement.
- **15% fresh vegetables** → hydration and nutrients.
- **5% pellets** → only as a supplement.
- **Fresh water** always available.

### Exercise
- Minimum 3–4 hours in spacious areas.
- Movement helps intestinal motility.

### Reduce Stress
- Calm environment.
- Companionship (another rabbit or you).
- Stable routines.

### Regular Brushing
- Especially during molting.
- Reduces hair ingestion.
